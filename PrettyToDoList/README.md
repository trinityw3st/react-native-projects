# 📝 React Native To-Do List App

Welcome to my **React Native To-Do List App**!  
This is a fun little productivity app (with an aesthetic theme) that helps you keep track of your daily tasks — built entirely using React Native and `react-native-paper` for some sleek icons.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This app is still a work-in-progress! Updates and new features are actively being developed.

## 🚀 Features

Here’s what the app currently does:

- ✅ **Add Tasks:** Type in a task and tap the **Add** button to add it to your list.
- 🗑️ **Delete Tasks:** Easily remove tasks you no longer need with the **trash-can** icon.
- ☑️ **Mark as Completed:** Toggle tasks as done/undone using the checkmark circle.
- 📜 **Live List Rendering:** Tasks update in real-time as you interact.
- 🍓 **Cute Background:** Because who doesn’t like strawberries? 🍓

## ✍️ Features Coming Soon

- ✏️ **Edit Tasks**: The **pencil** icon is already in place — just needs to be wired up! You'll be able to tap it to edit an existing task.
- 📲 **Better UI/UX**: More polish, animations, and better styling.
- 🎨 **Theme Toggle**: Maybe a light/dark mode?
